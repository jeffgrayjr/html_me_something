                    <h2>Early Life</h2>
                    <p>
                        Alan Mathison Turing was born in London on June 23, 1912 to parents Julius Mathison Turing and Ethel Sara Stoney. 
                        Alan had one older brother, John. His parents enrolled him in a day school at age 6, where the headmistress recognized
                        his talent even at such an early age. He then studied at Hazelhurst Preparatory School before beginning his studies at 
                        Sherborne School at age 13. He was very naturally inclined towards mathematics and science, solving advanced problems 
                        in math and physics without having studied calculus.

                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>
                        After his time at Sherborne, Alan went to King's College in Cambridge from 1931 to 1934 and was awarded first-class honours
                        in mathematics. In 1935 he was elected a fellow of King's College based on the strength of his dissertation. In 1936 he published
                        a paper which he discussed a "universal computing machine", later known as turing machines, which he was able to prove could perfrom any 
                        mathematical computation that could be represented as an algorithm. The mathematician John von Nuemann has stated that the concept of the 
                        the modern computer was due this paper.  Alan began his studies at Princeton University in September of 1936 and in June 1938 he obtained 
                        his PhD in Mathematics.

                    <h2>Work During the War</h2>

                    <p>
                        During World War 2, Alan began work with the GC&CS, the British code breaking group, at Bletchley Park. Here he helped develop 
                        a code breaking machine which was named the bombe, after the Polish code breaking  "Bomba" device on which it was based. The first 
                        bombe was installed in March of 1940. Having grown frustrated by lack of staff and funding, Alan and several colleagues wrote to 
                        Winston Churchill directly in October of 1941 to express their need and convey how great their contributions could be. Churchill 
                        instructed that they be provided with all they required and by the end of the war their were over 200 bombes in use. <br><br>
                        Other major advances Turing made during the war  included:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Solving the indicator system used by the German naval Enigma</li>
                            <li>Developing a sequential statisitcal technique to help break the German naval Enigma</li>
                            <li>Assisted at Bell Labs with the development of a secure speech device codenamed <em>Delilah</em></li>
                        </ul>
                        The impact of Bletchely Park's codebreaking efforts during the war are estimated by some historians to have shortened the war by as 
                        long as 4 years and have saved over 14 million lives.

                    <h2>Work Following the War</h2>
                    <p>
                        Following the war Alan worked at the National Physical Laboratory in London where he worked on the Automatic Computing 
                        Engine, or the ACE. In 1946 he wrote a paper which included a detailed design for a stored-program computer. In 1948 he 
                        was made a reader, rank between senior lecturer and professor, at the Victoria University of Manchester and in 1949 was made 
                        the Deputy Director of the Computing Laboratory there. He helped work on software for one of the very fisrt stored-program 
                        computers, the Manchester Mark 1. He also continued his work in mathematics and began to work on theories dealing with
                        artificial intelligence. In 1951 he began to study mathematical biology and morphogenesis, which is the development of 
                        patterns in plant structures.

                    <h2>Criminal Conviction</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 1952 Turing's home was robbed by a friend of Arnold Murray, who Turing was in a relationship with. Turing 
                        reported the crime to the police and during the investigation acknowledged that he was in a romantic relationship 
                        with Murray. Homosexuality was a criminal offense in Britain at the time and both men were charged with gross 
                        indecency. At the recomendation of both his lawyer and his older brother, Turing pled guilty and was given the 
                        choice between chemical castration and prison time. He chose chemical castration which was carried out over the 
                        course of one year. His conviction also led the the removal of security clearance and prevented him from working 
                        further with the British Government.

                    <h2>Death</h2>
                    <p>
                        On June 8th of 1954, Turing was found dead by his housekeeper. An autopsy found that he had been killed by a lethal 
                        dose of cyanide and his death was ruled a suicide, although historians and biographers have since questioned this 
                        and deemed it more likely that it was the result of accidental cyanide inhalation. On June 12th his remains were cremated 
                        and his ashes were spread.

                    <h2>Posthumous Pardon</h2>
                    <p>
                        In August of 2009 a petition was started urging the British government to issue a publicly apologize for Turing's conviction. 
                        The Prime Minister acknowledged it and issued a public statement. In December of 2011, another petition circulated urging 
                        that Turing be pardoned of his criminal conviction and after several years of campaigning a bill was introduced to pardon him. 
                        Due to delays in the House of Commons, Queen Elizabeth II chose instead to issue Turing a royal pardon. In Spetember of 2016, 
                        British Government announced an "Alan Turing Law" which granted pardons to all people who had been convicted under similar 
                        laws by the British Government.
